A spl syntax jsx is used --- html in js

Variable that can be used in DOM and Changed in React is Called State.

Component Folder is used to create different components in React

Inline CSS in jsx has a new and unique syntax:

Hooks:
-   useState() ex-
-   useEffect(): runs when a component is mounted. 
    ex- 
    ```javascript 
    useEffect(() => {
        alert("Welcome!!");
    }, []); // will run on all render.


    useEffect(() => {
        alert("Welcome!!");
    }, []); // will run only on first render.


    useEffect(() => {
    alert("Navbar color was changed to cyan.");
  }, [Navbar]); // change on particular component. You can use state as well


  useEffect(() => {
    // component mounted
  
    return () => {
      // component unmounted
    }
  }, [component/state])

  
    ```
- some initial alerts might run 2 times in dev mode. We can comment the React StrictMode to avoid this.
